Easily embed Snipt.net code snipts in your posts and pages.

== Description ==

Snipt.net is a free code hosting site that allows you easily store, share and embed code samples and "snipts". 

Snipt.net already provides a method of embedding your code within a site or blog post, but this requires the user to paste a Javascript script tag within the post or page content in the HTML editor. Once you switch to the Visual editor, you can no see the location of your embedded script within the content.

This plugin allows you to add the Snipt.net embed code with the click of a button and highlights the code location in both the HTML and Visual editors.

== Installation ==

Installation is easy.

1. Upload the snipt directory and it's contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Sign up for a Snipt.net account if you haven't already.
4. Click on the snipt button when you want to embed some code, and paste in the snipt.net embed script when requested.
